q1client.cpp is client that generates 10 frames. each frame of size 512 bits number randomly generated
CRC is done for each frame and CRC bits appended and randomly 10bits flipped and then send to B(q1server.cpp) which
acts as both server and client. B receives the CRC and appended bits. Again it does CRC check and changes the corrupted bits
and send it to C(q2client2.cpp).It receives the CRC appended number and gives output.
